The video has been successfully uploaded and processed. Here's what I know:

- **Video Type**: {analysis_type.replace('_', ' ').title()}
- **Focus Area**: {user_focus}
- **Status**: Ready for AI analysis

### Current Capabilities:
✅ Video file validated and uploaded
✅ Basic metadata extracted (duration, resolution, FPS)
✅ File integrity verified
✅ Session data stored

### What Happens Next:
To provide detailed answers about the video content, I need the AI model to be loaded on the server. Once that's available, I can:

- Describe what's happening in the video
- Identify objects, people, and actions
- Analyze scenes and events
- Answer specific questions about content
- Provide timestamps for key moments

✅ Technical specifications
✅ File structure and format

### What I Need for Detailed Answers:
To provide specific timestamps and moment-by-moment analysis, I need the AI model loaded to:
- Analyze video content frame by frame
- Identify key events and their timing
- Extract specific moments you're asking about
- Provide precise timestamps for actions

### Your Timing Question:

### For Your Specific Question:
"{message}" - This is exactly the type of detailed analysis I can provide once the AI model is loaded on the server.

### What I Can Do Now:
- Explain the analysis process
- Help with video setup questions
- Provide technical information
- Guide you through next steps

### Next Steps:
To get detailed answers to your question, the server needs the Qwen2.5-VL-32B model loaded. Once that's done, I'll be able to provide comprehensive analysis of your video content.
